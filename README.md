# dev-portfolio-app

A totally stand-alone React based developers portfolio website, taking all data
from a local JSON file.

This is still work in progress, should be done in a couple of days then can be
used by anyone.

Still to do :

- ~~Contact section.~~
- ~~Social media buttons.~~
- ~~floating back-to-top button.~~
- ~~tweaks and user info to the OpenSource section.~~
- ~~make the menu mobile-responsive.~~
- Full instructions in this README.
- more!

There is a live working version on my own pages : [https://www.gnramsay.com](https://www.gnramsay.com)
