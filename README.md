# dev-portfolio-app

A totally stand-alone React based developers portfolio website, taking all data
from a local JSON file.

This is still work in progress, should be done in a couple of days then can be
used by anyone.

Still to do :

- <del>Contact section<del>
- <del>Social media buttons<del>
- floating back-to-top button
- tweaks and user info to the OpenSource section.
- make the menu mobile-responsive [WIP]
- more!

There is a live working version on my own pages : https://www.gnramsay.com
